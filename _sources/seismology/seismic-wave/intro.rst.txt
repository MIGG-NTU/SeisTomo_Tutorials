Introduction
============

Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through Earth's interior, and are a result of seismic sources, e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides and man-made explosions.

There are two kinds of seismic waves, i.e., body wave and surface wave. Body wave is a seismic wave that moves through the interior of the earth, as opposed to surface waves that travel near the Earth's surface.

There are two kinds of body waves, i.e., P wave and S wave. P wave produces displacement in the direction of wave propagation and a volume change. S wave produces displacement perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and distort the material without any volume change.
