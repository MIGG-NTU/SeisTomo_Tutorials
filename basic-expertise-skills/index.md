## Operating system

There are three most commonly used operation systems for personal computers:
- Microsoft Windows
- Apple macOS
- Linux (CentOS, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, ...)

Most seismologists choose macOS or Linux as their primary operation system for daily researches, because both macOS and Linux provide easy access to toolchains needed in programming, and most existing programs/codes/packages for seismological researches were written on Linux and only work on Linux and macOS. As a beginner, you should use macOS or Linux. For Windows 10 users, you can install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on your Windows 10, just like installing any other Windows softwares. It may behave very similar to the pure Linux OS, but I have never tried it.

Please refer to the following references for a brief introduction about them:

## Linux/macOS basis and Command Lines

Seismologists usually use command lines (CLI) rather than Graphic User Interface (GUI) to navigate around different folders/directories, run programs, process data and almost everything you can imagine, because using CLI is usually much efficient than using GUI.

Please refer to the following references for some basis and commonly-used commands in Linux/macOS:

## Prgramming Languages

### Compiled Language

You need at least master one compiled language. The most popular compiled languages used in seismology community are C and Fortran. But at this time, you can skip this step and come back to learn one when you need it.

### Scripting Languages

Scripting Languages can also be called as interpreted Languages. It's usually easier to write and can accomplish complex tasks using only a few lines of codes. The only disadvantage is interpreted languages are usually much slower than compiled languages. There are many interpreted languages, the most used in seismology community are bash, Python (recommanded) and Matlab.

## Seismological Tools

- [SAC](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/sac/): Seismic Analysis Code, the most commonly used seismic data processing software | [Download](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac)
    - [Chinese manual](https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh): For a new SAC user, you can quickly look through the first four sections, i.e., [SAC brief introduction](https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh/introduction/), [SAC basis](https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh/basis/), [SAC format](https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh/fileformat/) and [SAC data processing](https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh/data-process/). Youcan learn details later when you use it to do real data processing.
