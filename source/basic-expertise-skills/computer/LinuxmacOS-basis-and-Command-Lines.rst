Linux/macOS Basis and Command Lines

Seismologists usually use command lines (CLI) rather than Graphic User Interface (GUI) to navigate around different folders/directories, run programs, process data and almost everything you can imagine, because using CLI is usually much efficient than using GUI.

Please refer to the following references for some basis and commonly-used commands in Linux/macOS:
