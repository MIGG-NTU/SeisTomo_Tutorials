Prgramming Languages
====================


Compiled Language
-----------------

You need at least master one compiled language. The most popular compiled languages used in seismology community are C and Fortran. But at this time, you can skip this step and come back to learn one when you need it.

Scripting Languages
-------------------

Scripting Languages can also be called as interpreted Languages. It's usually easier to write and can accomplish complex tasks using only a few lines of codes. The only disadvantage is interpreted languages are usually much slower than compiled languages. There are many interpreted languages, the most used in seismology community are bash, Python (recommanded) and Matlab.
