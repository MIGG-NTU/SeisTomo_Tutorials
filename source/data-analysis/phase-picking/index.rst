Phase Picking
=============


Hand-Picking
------------

Please refer to the lecture resources on 2020-12-14.

- pick arrival times via SAC 101.6a
- check arrival times


Automatic Picking
-----------------

We may use some automatic picking methods to save time, e.g., STA/LTA (`ObsPy Trigger/Picker Tutorial <https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/trigger_tutorial.html>`__). However, we may come back to this issue after we are familiar with seismic data and tools.
