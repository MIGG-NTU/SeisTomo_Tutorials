Phase Picking
=============


Hand-Picking
------------

- pick arrival times via SAC 101.6a
- check arrival times


Automatic Picking
-----------------

We may use some automatic picking methods to save time, e.g., STA/LTA. However, we may come back to this issue after we are familiar with seismic data and tools.
