Data Centers

**Data Centers:** https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh/appendix/data-fetch/


Nowadays, there are terabytes/petabytes of seismic data collected every years. Most oil & gas companies have their own data centers to store this data. In academia, some institutions also have their own exclusive data centers. Most seismic data in the United States is archived at the IRIS DMC. There are also other international/regional data centers.


IRIS
----

IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) is a consortium of over 120 US universities, dedicated to the operation of science facilities for the acquisition, management, and distribution of seismological data.

IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) is located near the University of Washington in Seattle. Most data at the IRIS DMC is open to public immediately or after an embargo of a period of time (e.g. 2 years).

There are many ways to download data from the IRIS DMC: https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/.
IRIS has developed several tools to download data: https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/tools/.
However, SOD is still one of the most popular tools we use.
