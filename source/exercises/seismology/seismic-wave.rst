Seismic Wave
============


Goals
-----

- learn how to calculate travle time of different seismic phases uing TauP
- learn different seismic phases

Task 0:  preparation
--------------------

1. Download and install TauP on your own computer


Task 1: calculate travel time
------------------------------

- command: ``taup_time``
- 1D Earthquake velocity model: ``ak135``
- earthquake depth: ``1 km``
- earthuake-station distance: ``50 km``
- seismic phases:

    - ``ttp``: a list of standard P phases
    - ``ttp+``: a list of standard P phases including depth phases
    - ``tts``: a list of standard S phases
    - ``tts+``: a list of standard S phases including depth phases
