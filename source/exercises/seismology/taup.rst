TauP
====

Here is a exercise to help you learn how to calculate the travle time of different seismic phases using TauP (`solution <https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/SeisTomo_Tutorials/raw/main/source/exercises/seismology/taup_time.sh>`__).

- command: ``taup_time``
- 1D Earthquake velocity model: ``ak135``
- earthquake depth: ``1 km``
- earthuake-station distance: ``50 km``
- seismic phases:

    - ``ttp``: a list of standard P phases
    - ``ttp+``: a list of standard P phases including depth phases
    - ``tts``: a list of standard S phases
    - ``tts+``: a list of standard S phases including depth phases
