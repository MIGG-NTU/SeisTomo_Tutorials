- The Chinese SAC Reference Manual: https://seisman.github.io/SAC_Docs_zh. Although this manual is written in Chinese, it's better than the official manual, at least for some chapters and sections. The manual provides more detailed descriptions on data processing to help beginners using SAC correctly. You can use Google Translate to translate it to English. For a new SAC user, you can quickly look through the first four sections. You can learn details later when you use it to do real data processing.
